What is NPM 
It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. This is the world's largest Software Registry.

Step 1 - Create an npm project 
 1.1 Create a folder named "my_demo_calculator" 
```mkdir my_demo_calculator```

1.2 Create an npm project 
``` npm init -y ``` 
It will turn your project folder into an npm package 

1.3 Create a file named "index.js" and add the following code to it. 
```
function add(x,y){
    return x+y;
}
function sub(x,y){
    return x-y;
}
function mul(x,y){
    return x*y;
}
function divide(x,y){
    return x/y;
}

module.exports = {add,sub,mul,divide}
```
1.3 (Optional) Create a README.md file and add it to the folder 

1.4 Login into the NPM Registry. You need to create an account on npmjs.com and use the same here

```npm login```

1.5 Publish the Package with the following command 
```npm publish```

That's It :)
