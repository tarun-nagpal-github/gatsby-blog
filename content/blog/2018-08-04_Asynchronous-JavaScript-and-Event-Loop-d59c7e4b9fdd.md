Hello People,

Do you know how JavaScript can handle 1,00,000 concurrent requests without blocking the browser or node server?

Do you wonder why JavaScript grown rapidly and compete with advance Technologies like Java and .NET?

I have answer for your questions.

I have recently gave the talk on “Asynchronous JavaScript and Event Loop”.

This code and slides will walk through with the concept of “Event Loop” which is the backbone of the major JavaScript Engines like [V8](https://v8.dev/)

You can download the code and the slides from the link below.
