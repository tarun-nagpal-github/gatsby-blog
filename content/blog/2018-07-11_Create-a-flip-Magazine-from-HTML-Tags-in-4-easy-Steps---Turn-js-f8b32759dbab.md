Turn JS

We often come to a situation where we need to give awesome flip/book page effect to our HTML pages and make them look like real magazines and books.

Recently, I have studied a library named Turn.js ([http://www.turnjs.com/](http://www.turnjs.com/)). This can make beautiful flip effects on the pages based on simple HTML.

It will make your content look like a real book or magazine using all the advantages of HTML5. It is a light weighted library (10Kb) with simple and clean API.

All you need to do is to provide a container and pass an ID to an HTML tag and you are good to go. All the elements (div, span, h1) in the container will become pages and your magazine/book is ready.

You can find the working Code [here](http://jsfiddle.net/A9a7E/14984/).
