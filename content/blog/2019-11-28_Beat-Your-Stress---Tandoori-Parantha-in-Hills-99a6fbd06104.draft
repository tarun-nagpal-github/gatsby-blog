Beat Your Stress - Tandoori Parantha in Hills

Hey Guys,

Are you tired of your daily routine of office/home etc?

Do you need to burn your stress in a day with a cool view of hills?

Are you working in Chandigarh or NCR and getting bored?

I recently got a chance to visit hills over a weekend on Kalka-Shimla Highway.

I saw a very good Dhaba (Local Restaurant) with a beautiful view of hills and decided to take a halt.
