Hey People,

I recently did a [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/webpack-fundamentals) on pluralsight for webpack by [Joe Eames](https://twitter.com/josepheames) and its wonderful experience.

I would like to share the top 5 reasons for using webpack in your project.

1.  Help Combining multiple files into one.
2.  Minification — It will help us reduce the code size.
3.  Maintain the file include order.
4.  Transpiling — It helps us make our code compatible with all the browsers.
5.  Linting — “to err is human”, It helps us displaying any Syntax and compilation errors in advance.
