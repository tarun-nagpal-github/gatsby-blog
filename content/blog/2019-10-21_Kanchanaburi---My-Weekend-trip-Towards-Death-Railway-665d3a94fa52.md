On the bridge over river kwai — Kanchanaburi (Thailand)

Hey People,

This is the first time that I am writing a blog on Travel. I usually write blogs on programming and Technology. But the topic forced me to do so.

I was one of the lucky people who got a chance to visit a beautiful and Hyped Country. None other than Thailand.

We all know that Thailand is famous for its NightLife and Dance Bars but there is much more beyond that.

**About Death Railway**

The Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway, was a 415-kilometer railway between Ban Pong, Thailand, and Thanbyuzayat, Burma.

It was built by the Empire of Japan in 1943 to support its forces in the Burma campaign of World War II.

This railway completed the rail link between Bangkok, Thailand, and Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar).

**A Weekend Trip Starts**

During my weekend, I Visited a beautiful and Historical City named [Kanchanaburi](https://goo.gl/maps/1Txhx2YxKX7HwonB9). It is 140 Km away from the capital city Bangkok and connected Via Railway (or Death Railway).

There are 2 Hollywood Movies on this place ( [The\_Bridge\_on\_the\_River\_Kwai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai) and [The Railway Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Railway_Man_%28film%29)) which makes it more famous among other cities.

**Getting There**

I reached to the Bangkok Railway Station and Boarded the Train towards Kanchanaburi and reached in 2 to 3 hours.

I took a hotel (Phurang Hill Resort) and it was a good welcome by the guests.

**Hotel Stay**

Taking an Overnight rest I started exploring the city in the morning.
