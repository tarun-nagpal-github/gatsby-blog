Hey People,

I hope you are doing great. In my learning path to react, I recently learned a very good package for rendering HTML tables to react.

Since I worked in Supply-Chain domain, So the system needs a robust and scalable solution for rendering tables to react.

There were many parameters/features we were looking like a solution. Some of them are listed below.

1\. Provide Dynamic Binding of data with Pagination.

2\. Sorting and Searching the records in real-time and with instant results.

3\. Page Count — Next and Previous Controls.

4\. Highly customize-able and theme-able with colors and design matched.

I would like to say Big Thanks to the library none other than React Table ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table)).

It is a lightweight, fast and extendable data-grid built for React.

It serves all the purpose and provides a hell lot of features that amazed me.

I have prepared a small demo along with the codebase to get the best of the plugin.

Demo Link — [https://react-table-extension.netlify.com/](https://react-table-extension.netlify.com/)

Github Code Repo — [https://github.com/tarun-nagpal-github/react-table-extension](https://github.com/tarun-nagpal-github/react-table-extension)

I have used this plugin and also extend it to provide an extra feature to show/hide the columns needed on the fly.

Let me guide you on the steps to use it and take this privilege in your next react project.

Step 1 — Install   
// TODO

Step 2 — Import the dependencies into your component   
// TODO

Step 3 — Add Columns for the Table   
// TODO

Step 4 — Add data for the Table   
// TODO

Step 5 — See your output via Simple Example   
// TODO

Step 6 (Optional) — Extend to add the Dynamic Column Filter   
// TODO

This is just my findings and things I explored
